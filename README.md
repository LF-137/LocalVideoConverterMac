With this project I create my own local video converter for MacOS.

It's more of a playground for how far I can get by letting AI program for me.
In reality, I don't know much about coding for OS environment nor the swift programming languange.
I just know about Data Science and python.

Still, I can build my own tools with AI in environments I am not used to. This way I figure out the limitations of current available free AI LLMs.
